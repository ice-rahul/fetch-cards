# Introduction

Fetch Cards - It is a simple create react application which fetches the card using apollo graphql client

# Requirements
1. Create a new schema object that will hit the `characters` API instead of the `character`
2. Generate the types for the new schema by running `npm run generate`
3. Use the `characters` hook that was generated to fetch an array of characters
4. Iterate through the characters and display them
5. Feel free to use the filtering options that exist in the API and build an interface in the app to search, or filter by specific attributes of the characters!
6. The app is ugly, so feel free to improve our CSS in any way you see fit!
7. Extract and display more info from the characters instead of just their names and pictures
